# Recurrence_relations_uni_group_project

This is a university group project where we designed a website using HTML and CSS. It discusses what a recurrence relation is, and explains what the Fibonacci sequence and Mandlebrot set are. This was a first attempt at a website for us so it introduced us to HTML code and how to be creative in customising it with CSS. 

The HTML and CSS file are included above.
